#Math foundation
##Matrix
I have not study it systematically.Time should be invested to this subject.
##Numerical Analysis
It mainly talks about 8 topics,such as solutions to linear equations,calculations to characteristical value and vector and so on.It is a difficile subject which needs the understanding of algorithm and the ability of programming.In the subsequent weeks, I need focus on it and acquire the main knowledge skilly.
#Programming
##lisp
I began to read the book "practical common lisp",and had configured my emacs integrated with slime.But after finishing the first chapter,I switched to "seven languages in seven weeks - a pragmatic guide to learning programming languages" and began to learn haskell.
##ruby && rails
In September and October,I learned ruby language and the framwork called rails.And realize the functions about auto-complete in a search box and a rich editor.
##algorithm
Learning algorithm is,I think,the most pressing thing to do or ability I want get.I finished sevral easy problems in UVA online judge.And began to watch the open course "Introdution of algorithm" published by MIT.
##github
Submitting to github is a encouraging and funny experience.And I plan to submit my code continuous for 180 days.
#On ubuntu platform
##emacs
I configured my emacs to an useful tool for myself,but futhur configuration when needed.
##Research about
Jabref used to read document.Latex to write paper.wiznote to record notes.Yunnuo to synch files.
#Research
Focus on complexity.Read the book "hidden order - how adaption builds complexity".Complexity is intresting topic.And I should pay more attention about reading documents about this topic.
